Diabetes Prediction Using SVM - Interesting Machine Learning Projects

**Requirements for this project
→ Python
→ Support Vector Machine


First of all, we will talk about Support Vector Machine. 
SVM is one of the most popular Supervised Learning algorithms, which is used for Classification as well as Regression problems. 
However, primarily, it is used for Classification problems in Machine Learning.
The goal of the SVM algorithm is to create the best line or decision boundary that can segregate n-dimensional space into classes so that we can easily put the new data point in the correct category in the future. This best decision boundary is called a hyperplane.

Diabetes Data→ Take data from hospitals or patients.

Data Preprocessing → We need to preprocess data where we will try to analyze the data and this data won't be very suitable to feed to the machine learning model and we need to standardize this data at first because there is a lot of medical information and we want all these data to be on the same bridge. So, what we do is to standardize all of this data so that all this data will lie in the same range.
And all these things will be done in the data pre-processing.

Train-test-split → We will train our machine learning model with training data and then we will try to find the accuracy score of our model with the help of test data. So simply, it will tell us how well our model is performing.
So once, we had done with splitting of data into training and testing data.

Support Vector Machine Classifier → Now, we will feed data to our SVM classifier model. We will be using a classifier model where this model will classify whether the patient is diabetic or non-diabetic. 
Once, we have trained it. We'll have a trained SVM classifier. So, when we give a new data. So, it can now predict whether the patient is diabetic or non-diabetic.
